# Property-Price

## Business problem: 
The aim of the model is to help property seekers like me secure apartments at fair prices. To this end I created a model to predict the rent price of a Condo in Singapore on the basis of location, amenities, size, number of bathrooms and number of bedrooms.

## Source of data: 
Scraped 7500+ property details from www.99.co using scrapy

Cleaned and explored data, and engineered features to get the data ready for modelling

Models used: Multiple Linear Regression, Lasso Regression and Random Forests finding best hyperparameters using GridSearchCV

Evaluation metrics: Mean absolute error

## Outcome: 
The final model has a mean absolute error of SG$400
